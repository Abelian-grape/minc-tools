	* Modify sequence handling to better conform to the DICOM
	specification.  This means handling group 0xfffe items as
	magically conforming to implicit VR format. See DICOM Part 5,
	section 7.5 for more details.	
	* Fix bug that prevented any data element from ever being tagged
	as "variable length".  This bug prevented us from properly parsing
	files with sequences with unspecified lengths.
	* Modify acr_get_element_total_length() to return zero if the
	vr_name is NULL.  This avoids a core dump when erroneously parsing
	non-DICOM files.
	* Also got rid of small memory leak in sequence reading.
	* Other random tweaks and cleanup.

	* Autoconfiscation
	* Move headers into acr_nema subdirectory to avoid naming
	conflicts
	* Get rid of mktemp() warnings by using mkstemp().
