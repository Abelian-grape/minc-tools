I beleive that there is a bug in xfmconcat in case when more then one
grid transform gets concatenated (here I am refering to minc-1.0, so
disregard the whole thing if it has been fixed in 1.1).  What happens
is that all grid files involved in concatenation get the same
name. This way they get overwritten during copying and the end product
is a transfrom in which all displacement volumes are one and the same,
namely the last one that appears in the concatenation.
