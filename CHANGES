Thu Jan 20 15:36:04 EST 2000
   - Re-arranged headers in volume_io so that only volume_io.h needs to be 
     on the search path. Other header files are installed in the 
     volume_io subdirectory and found by volume_io.h. 
     (Patch from Steve Robbins.)

Fri Nov 13 11:02:51 EST 1998
   - Modified acrnema library to support asynchronous transfers in the
     client routines (allow sending of next message before receiving 
     reply to previous one).

Wed Nov 11 11:28:34 EST 1998
   - Modifications to acrnema library: Added functions acr_find_group and 
     acr_group_steal_element. Increased default buffer size to 64KB.

Thu Feb 19 09:06:38 EDT 1998
   - Fixes to internals of mincreshape that had not yet shown symptoms,
     but appeared with insure++.

Thu Aug 13 15:35:15 EDT 1998
   - Modified mincconcat so that the coordinate variable corresponding
     to the concatenation dimension is always created, subscripted
     with by the dimension (like an irregularly-spaced
     dimension). This is required by some programs that want all of
     the time points (in particular) to be stored even for a
     regularly-spaced dimension.

Mon Jun 22 10:06:29 EDT 1998
   - Fixed bug in rawtominc in handling of default types and signs. This
     bug showed up when options -short and -scan_range were used with data 
     containing negative values.

Wed Apr 22 16:23:06 EDT 1998
   - Fixed a bug in fortran test program minc_ftest.f in which an 
     insufficient number of arguments were being passed to miclos.

Mon Mar 23 15:17:49 EST 1998
   - Moved some functions in the acr-nema library from one file to another.

Tue Mar 17 12:05:43 EST 1998
   - Modified acrnema library so that default maximum length for client
     connections is 1MB to fix problems with servers that do not handle
     maximum length 0 (unlimited).

Tue Mar 10 12:07:28 EST 1998
   - Fixed more bugs in acrnema library to prevent core dumps under Linux 
     when a protocol error occurs while reading a message. Also fixed handling
     of last fragment bit for DICOM command PDV's. Re-organized code to
     use watchpoints more consistently in dicom_network.c

Fri Feb 20 12:29:18 EST 1998
   - Fixed bug in acrnema library (dicom_client_routines) that sometimes
     caused write errors under irix 5.3.

Thu Feb 19 10:05:34 EST 1998
   - Minor bug fixes.

Wed Feb 18 15:29:28 EST 1998
   - Minor bug fixes in libacrnema.

Mon Sep 29 08:24:20 EDT 1997
   - Modified rawtominc so that its argument error messages are more explicit.

Wed Sep 17 09:24:32 EDT 1997
   - Modified gcomserver to do conversions to dicom and retransmit data
     to a dicom server.

Thu Sep 11 10:54:41 EDT 1997
   - Copied in new version of volume_io. The version released with minc 0.5
     was missing function set_volume_translation. It has been re-instated.

Thu Sep 11 09:46:51 EDT 1997
   - Modified gcomserver to have project file syntax that allows different
     things to be done to the data. The old syntax is still supported.

Wed Sep 10 15:31:27 EDT 1997
   - Small modification to dicomserver (siemens_dicom_read.c) to 
     set default direction cosines properly if they are absent from
     the dicom data.

Mon Sep 08 17:52:21 EDT 1997
   - Added dicom client routines to acr_nema library.
   - Added new status for connection timeout to acr_nema library.

Tue Sep 02 18:52:12 EDT 1997
   - Fixed acr_nema library (element.c) padding of UI-type elements
     (pad with NUL instead of blank).

************************************************************************

Thu Aug 21 09:22:18 EDT 1997 *** RELEASE OF MINC 0.5

Wed Aug 13 19:30:00 EDT 1997
   - Changes to acr-nema library: Fixed bug that was causing the loss of
     PDU items on read in dicom_network.c. Added function 
     acr_group_remove_element to group.c.
Wed Aug 13 12:09:37 EDT 1997
   - Copied in new release of volume_io
Wed Aug 13 11:44:38 EDT 1997
   - Fixed initialization bug in mincresample that caused it to always
     crash under Linux
Tue Aug 12 11:44:38 EDT 1997
   - Added new program mincmakevector for assembling a list of scalar
     files into one vector file.
Thu Aug  7 11:44:38 EDT 1997
   - Added new program mincmakescalar for converting vector volumes
     to scalar by various schemes.
Fri Jun 20 09:59:47 EDT 1997
   - Fixed bug in voxel_loop that affected mincconcat when concatenating
     4D (or greater) files. Basically, when there are no output files
     and accumulation is used, then an outer loop over files is done
     (process each file in order). With 4D or greater input files, the first
     volume of each file would be handled correctly, but subsequent volumes
     would only have the last slice read in.
Tue Jun  3 10:59:29 EDT 1997
   - Really corrected dimension width suffix added by mincconcat. 
     Changed to _width to -width (fix of Aug 27, 1996 was not complete)

************************************************************************

Wed May  7 16:05:05 EDT 1997 *** RELEASE OF MINC 0.4

Wed May  7 15:09:58 EDT 1997
   - Changed distribution script to use gzip instead of compress.
Thu Apr 24 13:48:51 EDT 1997
   - Added mincmath options: -maximum, -minimum, -abs, 
     -illegal_value and -count_valid.
Wed Apr 23 10:58:02 EDT 1997
   - Added code to volume_io/Prog_utils/files.c to handle missing strerror
     (on SunOS). Modified configure.in and Make_machine_specific.in to 
     define constant in this case (through GLOBAL_CDEFINES).
   - Fixed progs install so that directories with more than one binary 
     will get them all installed under linux (bash seems to have a problem
     with my Bourne shell code).
   - Added dependencies for install targets. They were removed at one
     point, but it seems safer to have them in. They'll probably disappear
     at a later point, and perhaps I'll make a note of the reason...!
   - Added options -maximum, -minimum, -abs, -illegal_value and -count_valid
     to mincmath. Fixed handling of invalid or uninitialized data for
     cumulative operations.
Mon Apr 21 13:33:55 EDT 1997
   - Fixed icv calculation of scale so that values are never re-scaled
     from their internal "real" value to an external floating-point type
     (or the other way around). Previously, this re-scaling could occur if
     normalization was turned off and a valid range was set in the file.
Thu Apr 17 14:45:18 EDT 1997
   - Added option of setting BUILD_FORTRAN to "no" for configure.
   - Moved building of volume_io documentations to docs directory.
   - Added explicit path to run_tests script
Thu Apr 10 15:23:32 EDT 1997
   - Fixed icv handling of invalid data when the scale factor is zero. When
     this happens fillvalue checking is turned on (for both input and
     output) regardless of the user setting. This fixes problems when
     mincmath is writing out a uniform image that contains invalid data
     as well.
   - Removed redefinition of NULL from library header file and added
     casts to pointer types in places where it matters.
Mon Mar 10 15:23:32 EDT 1997
   - Updated ACR-NEMA library to handle dicom messages.
Wed Jan 15 11:26:28 EST 1997
   - Fixed small bug in test program minc_types.c so that handling of FLT_MAX
     is done properly and output agrees with original output and
Tue Jan 14 14:47:40 EST 1997
   - Added Fortran wrappers miopn, micre and miclos
Tue Jan  7 14:47:40 EST 1997
   - Added -origin option to rawtominc.
Tue Dec 10 09:30:21 EST 1996
   - Modified top-level Makefile
      - added targets libs, programs, test and docs
      - default make no longer does make in docs directory
Tue Aug 27 13:08:18 EDT 1996
   - Corrected dimension width suffix added by mincconcat. Changed to _width 
     to -width.
Wed Jul 10 13:08:18 EDT 1996
   - Modified minclookup:
      - added output type options
      - added -lut_string
      - added handling of duplicate first or last lookup table entries
      - added man page
Wed Jun 19 14:26:33 EDT 1996
   - Catch errors in opening file specified with -input for rawtominc
Tue Jan 16 08:30:08 EST 1996
   - Added -invert option to mincmath
Wed Dec 13 08:47:26 EST 1995
   - Added -check_dimensions and -nocheck_dimensions options to mincmath.
   - Improved tmp dir cleanup in mincview when an error occurs.
   - Small changes to minc_modify_header man page.
Tue Dec 12 14:19:07 EST 1995
   - Added convert_origin_to_start routines to Proglib to handle conversion
     of a point to a start value given 3 direction cosines
   - Modified mincresample:
      - modified argument parsing so that only one pass is done
      - changed default to transform input sampling when -transformation
        is specified and added options -tfm_input_sampling (to get above 
        behaviour) and -use_input_sampling (to get old behaviour).
      - added -origin option to specify a coordinate instead of dimension
        start values.
      - added -standard_sampling option.
      - added -invert_transformation option.
      - added -spacetype, -talairach and -units options.
Mon Nov 20 14:24:47 EST 1995
   - Added -weights option to mincaverage.
Thu Nov 16 13:11:16 EST 1995
   - Include math.h in rawtominc, mincwindow, mincinfo, mincconcat 
     and Acr_nema library to get declaration of strtod under SunOs.
Wed Oct  4 19:05:25 EDT 1995
   - Fixed default minimum for signed long.
Fri Sep 29 12:59:06 EDT 1995
   - Modified micopy_all_atts in library to handle MI_ERROR being passed
     as a variable id.
   - Fixed handling of image-min/max in mincconcat when the variables are
     not present in the input files.
Wed Aug  2 13:41:36
   - Added -prefix option to gyrotominc.
Fri Jun 16 08:28:39 EDT 1995
   - Modified mincview so that file name appears in xv window frame.
Tue Jun 13 16:44:28 EDT 1995
   - Improved test for ANSI compiler in configure script. Check that
     (signed char *) is handled properly (since the Solaris compiler
     doesn't handle it from what I've been told).
   - Improved configuration for fortran compilation. Set FORTRAN_SUBDIR
     and FORTRAN_OBJ from configure only if f77 is found and the system
     is irix.
Mon Jun 12 13:32:53 EDT 1995
   - Added MI_LABEL modality to minc.h
   - Modified miexpand_file and miopen to try adding compression
     extensions to filenames if the first open fails.
