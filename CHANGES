   - Added code to volume_io/Prog_utils/files.c to handle missing strerror
     (on SunOS). Modified configure.in and Make_machine_specific.in to 
     define constant in this case (through GLOBAL_CDEFINES).
   - Fixed progs install so that directories with more than one binary 
     will get them all installed under linux (bash seems to have a problem
     with my Bourne shell code).
   - Added dependencies for install targets. They were removed at one
     point, but it seems safer to have them in. They'll probably disappear
     at a later point, and perhaps I'll make a note of the reason...!
   - Added options -maximum, -minimum, -abs, -illegal_value and -count_valid
     to mincmath. Fixed handling of invalid or uninitialized data for
     cumulative operations.
Mon Apr 21 13:33:55 EDT 1997
   - Fixed icv calculation of scale so that values are never re-scaled
     from their internal "real" value to an external floating-point type
     (or the other way around). Previously, this re-scaling could occur if
     normalization was turned off and a valid range was set in the file.
Thu Apr 17 14:45:18 EDT 1997
   - Added option of setting BUILD_FORTRAN to "no" for configure.
   - Moved building of volume_io documentations to docs directory.
   - Added explicit path to run_tests script
Thu Apr 10 15:23:32 EDT 1997
   - Fixed icv handling of invalid data when the scale factor is zero. When
     this happens fillvalue checking is turned on (for both input and
     output) regardless of the user setting. This fixes problems when
     mincmath is writing out a uniform image that contains invalid data
     as well.
   - Removed redefinition of NULL from library header file and added
     casts to pointer types in places where it matters.
Mon Mar 10 15:23:32 EDT 1997
   - Updated ACR-NEMA library to handle dicom messages.
Wed Jan 15 11:26:28 EST 1997
   - Fixed small bug in test program minc_types.c so that handling of FLT_MAX
     is done properly and output agrees with original output and
Tue Jan 14 14:47:40 EST 1997
   - Added Fortran wrappers miopn, micre and miclos
Tue Jan  7 14:47:40 EST 1997
   - Added -origin option to rawtominc.
Tue Dec 10 09:30:21 EST 1996
   - Modified top-level Makefile
      - added targets libs, programs, test and docs
      - default make no longer does make in docs directory
Tue Aug 27 13:08:18 EDT 1996
   - Corrected dimension width suffix added by mincconcat. Changed to _width 
     to -width.
Wed Jul 10 13:08:18 EDT 1996
   - Modified minclookup:
      - added output type options
      - added -lut_string
      - added handling of duplicate first or last lookup table entries
      - added man page
Wed Jun 19 14:26:33 EDT 1996
   - Catch errors in opening file specified with -input for rawtominc
Tue Jan 16 08:30:08 EST 1996
   - Added -invert option to mincmath
Wed Dec 13 08:47:26 EST 1995
   - Added -check_dimensions and -nocheck_dimensions options to mincmath.
   - Improved tmp dir cleanup in mincview when an error occurs.
   - Small changes to minc_modify_header man page.
Tue Dec 12 14:19:07 EST 1995
   - Added convert_origin_to_start routines to Proglib to handle conversion
     of a point to a start value given 3 direction cosines
   - Modified mincresample:
      - modified argument parsing so that only one pass is done
      - changed default to transform input sampling when -transformation
        is specified and added options -tfm_input_sampling (to get above 
        behaviour) and -use_input_sampling (to get old behaviour).
      - added -origin option to specify a coordinate instead of dimension
        start values.
      - added -standard_sampling option.
      - added -invert_transformation option.
      - added -spacetype, -talairach and -units options.
Mon Nov 20 14:24:47 EST 1995
   - Added -weights option to mincaverage.
Thu Nov 16 13:11:16 EST 1995
   - Include math.h in rawtominc, mincwindow, mincinfo, mincconcat 
     and Acr_nema library to get declaration of strtod under SunOs.
Wed Oct  4 19:05:25 EDT 1995
   - Fixed default minimum for signed long.
Fri Sep 29 12:59:06 EDT 1995
   - Modified micopy_all_atts in library to handle MI_ERROR being passed
     as a variable id.
   - Fixed handling of image-min/max in mincconcat when the variables are
     not present in the input files.
Wed Aug  2 13:41:36
   - Added -prefix option to gyrotominc.
Fri Jun 16 08:28:39 EDT 1995
   - Modified mincview so that file name appears in xv window frame.
Tue Jun 13 16:44:28 EDT 1995
   - Improved test for ANSI compiler in configure script. Check that
     (signed char *) is handled properly (since the Solaris compiler
     doesn't handle it from what I've been told).
   - Improved configuration for fortran compilation. Set FORTRAN_SUBDIR
     and FORTRAN_OBJ from configure only if f77 is found and the system
     is irix.
Mon Jun 12 13:32:53 EDT 1995
   - Added MI_LABEL modality to minc.h
   - Modified miexpand_file and miopen to try adding compression
     extensions to filenames if the first open fails.
