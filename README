MINC Tools

This packages is a collection of tools that work on MINC format
images

Here's a list of some of the tools:
 * rawtominc, minctoraw, mincextract - format conversion
 * mincheader, mincdiff, mincinfo, minchistory - file information
 * mincedit, minc_modify_header - header manipulation
 * mincresample - arbitrary volume resampling
 * mincreshape - extraction of volume sub-cubes, image flipping,
      dimension re-ordering, type conversion
 * mincconcat - concatenating or interleaving images from multiple
      files
 * mincmath - perform simple math on files
 * minccalc - perform more complicated math on files through an expression
 * mincaverage - average minc files
 * mincstats - calculate statistics across voxels of a file
 * minclookup - lookup table operations for arbitrary re-mappings of
      intensities
 * worldtovoxel, voxeltoworld - coordinate conversion
 * xfmconcat, xfminvert - generalized transformation utilities
 * mincview - simple image display using xv or ImageMagick
 * mincpik - generate picture from slice through volume
