* check addition in rev 1.72 of volume_io/Volumes/volumes.c

* rationalize the testing into "testdir/".  I initially put 
  stuff in volume_io/Testing in order to separate the testing of
  minc proper from testing of volume_io.  But some of the "minc"
  utilities (xfmconcat, xfminvert) use volume_io, so there is no
  real separation, it seems.  Might as well move all testing stuff
  to testdir.

* fix problem with YYDEBUG
  - see message of 2003-06-03 to minc-users by Anders Bertil Rodell

  Possibly something has #defined YYDEBUG to 0.  Did you happen to notice
  whether yacc (or bison) rebuilt progs/minccalc/gram.c from
  progs/minccalc/gram.y?  Check the timestamps on the two files to see if the
  .c is newer than .y.

  I just built MINC and it worked.  Then I rebuilt the gram.c file before
  compiling and got the same message you did.
