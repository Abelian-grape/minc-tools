                        INSTALLATION

This document describes how to build and install the minc package on
a UNIX system.

1) Make sure that the netcdf package has been compiled and installed. 
   Version 2.3.2 is known to work.

2) Copy the appropriate Make_machine_specific.<osname> over the file
   Make_machine_specific. Currently there are files for Silicon Graphics
   machines running Irix 4.x and 5.x (the irix4 file works for both) and
   for Suns running SunOS (tested on SunOS 4.1.3). Note that the compiler
   used for building the package must be roughly ANSI-compatible 
   (prototypes, void, enum, etc.), thus we use gcc for SunOS.

3) Modify the configuration file Make_configuration. The fortran jackets
   work on SGIs but not on SUNs. Note that installation is not a true
   installation, but simply a copy. I prefer to simply copy the libraries,
   includes, binaries and man pages into four directories in the 
   distribution from which they can be installed manually.

4) Type "make" in this directory. This will run some tests after building
   the package.

5) Type "make install" to copy files into the INSTALL directories.
