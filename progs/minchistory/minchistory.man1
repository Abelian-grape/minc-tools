.SH NAME
minchistory - prints out history information for a minc file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minchistory
[-data] <infile>

.SH DESCRIPTION 
\fIMinchistory\fR is a \fBperl\fR script that prints the history 
information in a collection of MINC files.  Most MINC files contain an
internal "audit trail" that lists the commands used to create the 
MINC file.  This tool provides a convenient way to examine this information.

For each file, \fIminchistory\fR prints a title line of the format:
.IP
--- History of \fIfilename\fR ---
.PP
Followed by a series of lines which list the history information for
that file.

.SH OPTIONS
There are no options.
