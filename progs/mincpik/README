WHATS HERE:

   * mincpik.pl  - MIFF file gererator (Imagemagick's internal file format) 
                      from MINC files.
   * rugister.pl - Script that mimicks register from the MNI in that it produces 
                      the three views (Transverse, Coronal, Saggital) of a 3D volume
                      from the origin.          

WHAT YOU'LL NEED:

   * The minc and netcdf libraries - 
        http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/software/
   * The ImageMagick conversion utilities  
        http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html
        compiled without 16-bit quanta. (the default)

HOW TO USE THEM:

   * To display a default view, transverse slicing, middle slice
     using display. (display is part of the Imagemagick package)

        mincpik infile.mnc | display -
   
   * To generate a PNG file of the 15th coronal slice
   
        mincpik -slice 15 -coronal infile.mnc outfile.png

   * To display something akin to register of a MINC file
   
        rugister infile.mnc
