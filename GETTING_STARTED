Very briefly, MINC (Medical Image NetCDF) is built on the general data
format NetCDF (from the UCAR - University Corporation for Atmospheric
Research). When programming with minc, there are a number of levels to
deal with: 

1) NetCDF is the basis of it all, providing a C and Fortran callable
library for accessing data structures in a file at a low-level. Two
applications exist for dumping data to text and converting that text
back into a NetCDF file.  Documentation exists in the form of a NetCDF
User's Guide and of an emacs info page.

2) The low-level MINC library (again C and Fortran callable) is used
with NetCDF routines to do medical-image specific things. It provides
some enhancements to NetCDF (automatic type conversion, for example),
as well as image conversion routines for dealing with image pixel
value issues as well as image size and orientation. Documentation
consists of a programmer's guide and reference (minc_user.tex (.dvi)
and minc_reference.tex (.dvi) in the minc/doc directory). An example
C program exists in minc/progs/mincexample.

3) A high-level C library called volume_io provides a Volume data
type, with functions like input_volume to give simple access to data
while handling issues of pixel range conversion and voxel-to-world
coordinate conversion. There is no documentation for this, but the
source lives in minc/volume_io. An example program exists in 
minc/volume_io/example called convert_volume_to_byte.c

4) Generic MINC applications. Check minc/bin/*minc*. All
applications should take the -help option for a listing of options.
Man pages exist for mincresample, rawtominc, mincheader and mincinfo (these
are found in minc/man).

5) Specific MINC applications like register (for displaying one or two
minc volumes and doing point tagging) and postf (display minc images).
A man page exists for register and postf has -help option (for
options) and a -describe option for some details. These are available from
the Montreal Neurological Institute on request (contact 
Peter Neelin <neelin@pet.mni.mcgill.ca>).

The include file for minc is in ../include (just include <minc.h>,
netcdf.h will automatically be included).  Volume_io includes are in
../include/volume_io (just include <volume_io.h>). Library
files are in ../lib.
